# Google-Home-Page
I always wished a revamped version of Google Home Page. This repository hold the code for yet another simplistic Google's home page with its all new logo. Further more, I have increased the search font-size considerably because its just the single most thing I come to type on the Google.com so, let it sound big and important. 

You can also type in the long tail keywords and see the font-size shrink as the length increases. And, as always you are welcomed to commit and suggest the changes.
